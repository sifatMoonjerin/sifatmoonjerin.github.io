Sifat Moonjerin, also known as Srizon among friends, is a passionate software engineer working at [SELISE Digital Platforms](https://selise.ch/). He also has a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. Besides staring at the monitor all day, he likes to learn new stuff. Currently, he is exploring different memory techniques to memorize a bunch of random information, such as the order of a shuffled deck of cards and the first 100 digits of PI. However, he does not remember what he had for breakfast today.
