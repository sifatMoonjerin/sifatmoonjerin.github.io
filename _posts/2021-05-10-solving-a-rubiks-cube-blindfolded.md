About a month ago, I came across a random YouTube video on how to solve a Rubik's cube blindfolded. Though it seemed impossible, I thought of giving it a go anyway. At that time, I could barely solve a cube with my eyes wide open, let alone blindfolded. Currently, it takes around 7 to 8 minutes to memorize and solve the cube blindfolded using the Old Pochmann method.
