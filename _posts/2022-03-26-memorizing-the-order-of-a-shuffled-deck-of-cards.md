The number above represents the possible permutations of a single deck of cards. So, at first, it might seem impossible to memorize a shuffled deck of cards. However, there is a trick to this madness. And after memorizing my first deck, I fell in love with the process. I never thought that memorizing can be so exciting! In this article, I will update my progress every week. My target is to memorize the order of a shuffled deck in under two minutes!

### Week 1
#### Best time: 04:52.46
I am using the PAO method (Person-Action-Object) and a memory palace to memorize a deck of cards. In the PAO method, each card represents a person who is doing something with an object. For example, the king of hearts can be the joker stabbing someone with a pencil. Ouch! 
Initially, I spent the first two days assigning a person to each card and made a list in google docs. The idea is to create an image from three cards. The person of the first card, the action of the second card, and the object of the third card will form an image. There will be 17 images and an extra card to remember. After that, I spent the next day creating my first memory palace to store these images. 
On my first attempt, it took me 12 minutes and 39 seconds! Far from my target of memorizing a deck in under two minutes! After practicing for a few more days, I managed to drag the time under five minutes! To be precise, it took 4 minutes and 52 seconds!

### Week 2
#### Best time: 03:59.86
I have managed to memorize a deck in under 4 minutes, and on average, it takes around four and a half minutes. It has been an adventurous two weeks of memorization. However, I am thinking about taking a break next week!
